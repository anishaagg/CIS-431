Distortion Description:
	I decided to invert the colors of a pnm image. I felt like this filter provided a very visible difference in what the image looked like at first glance and had the ability to be parallelized.

Commands run:
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ make
g++ -g -I. -c filters_p.C
g++ main.o image.o sink.o source.o PNMreader.o PNMwriter.o filters_p.o filters_ph.o -o parallel_invert
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./serial_invert duckie.pnm serial.pnm
@time of serial run:			[80.740] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./serial_invert duckie.pnm serial.pnm
@time of serial run:			[71.413] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./serial_invert duckie.pnm serial.pnm
@time of serial run:			[78.683] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./parallel_invert duckie.pnm parallel.pnm
@time of serial run:			[9.821] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./parallel_invert duckie.pnm parallel.pnm
@time of serial run:			[8.730] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13
Anishas-MacBook-Air-2:labassignment1 anishaa$ ./parallel_invert duckie.pnm parallel.pnm
@time of serial run:			[8.210] million cycles
printf: 1.84467e+13


Observations:
	After running the both serial and parallel inversions 3 times each, I noticed that the number of cycles were not always the same. 

Comparison:
	The outcome files are the exact same which is what I was expecting.
	The number of cycles for the inversion using parallel programming was 9x faster than the serial programming.

Justification:
	The reason the parallel inversion was consistently about 9x faster was because it was SIMD. Whereas serial inversion is SISD.
